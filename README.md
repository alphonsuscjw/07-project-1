Project Description
-----------------------------

In this project we have performed analysis on the US and Australian economies. We have tried to find the patterns which are similar i.e. Inflation and wage growth and answered the questions such as:

Does Australian economy follow US economy?

# Data Sources
--------------

We have extracted data from a number of data sources such as rba.com.au.

We have also used NASDAQ API to fetch the global oil prices for last 30 years.

# Working
---------

As first step, we cleaned and merged data sets. We have used the Pandas library to make dataframes to perform analysis.

We used Matplotlib library to plot charts.

# Analysis
----------
We have answered four questions as analysis summary.

Q: Is there a correlation between US and Australian inflation?
A: Yes, they follow the similar pattern.

Q: Is there a correlation between US and Australian wage growth to inflation.
A: Yes, both US and Australian wage growth follow the trends of inflation but have lagged behind historically.

Q: Does global Oil prices affect the inflation of US and Australia?
A: As it is very visible in the Oil prices vs Inflation charts, the Oil prices does dictate the inflation rate in both US and Australia. If oil prices go up, the inflation rate also follow and goes up and converse is true.

Q: Does Australian economy follow the pattern of US economy?
A: The patterns of wage growth and Inflation in both countries are very similar. So we can say that YES, Australian economy does follow the patterns of US economy.
